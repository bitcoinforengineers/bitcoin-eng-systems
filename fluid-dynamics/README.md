## üíß Flow-Based Model

| Element             | Analogy                       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BTC**             | Fluid particles               | Sats = monetary molecules in motion                                         |
| **Proof-of-Work**   | Pressure differential         | Drives economic energy from one node to another                            |
| **Miners**          | Pumps                         | Push BTC into circulation under cost-pressure dynamics                      |
| **Exchanges**       | Valves                        | Gatekeepers of flow direction and flow rate                                 |
| **Lightning Network**| Laminar flow piping          | Fast, low-resistance parallel microchannels                                 |
| **Fees**            | Turbulence                    | Congestion, inefficiency in the on-chain plumbing                          |
| **Liquidity Crises**| Cavitation                    | Dangerous loss of flow due to vanished volume                               |

## üß† Design Intent

This metaphor helps explain Bitcoin‚Äôs capital velocity, liquidity crises, and network topology.  
It bridges macro liquidity models with real-world physical systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Animate transaction flow like CFD simulation
- Visualize fee spikes as turbulence
- Model Lightning as micro-capillaries
