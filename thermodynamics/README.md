## üß† Design Intent

Bitcoin is a heat engine. Its ledger is entropy-reduction.  
The system resists disorder by demanding energy to create order ‚Äî one block at a time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Plot energy input/output curves over time
- Build animations of entropy decreasing as blocks form
- Visualize difficulty as load pressure
