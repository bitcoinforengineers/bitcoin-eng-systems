## üîå Electrical Circuit Model

| Element          | Analogy Element         | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin (BTC)**| Electrons                | The fundamental monetary energy particles ‚Äî the signal itself        |
| **Proof-of-Work**| Voltage Source           | The driving potential that pushes BTC through the system             |
| **Miners**       | Generator                | Convert raw energy into Bitcoin ‚Äî the creation engine                |
| **MSTR**         | Amps (Current)           | Amplifies Bitcoin exposure as current through the capital circuit    |
| **STRK**         | Switch                   | Routes capital flow into/out of Bitcoin exposure                     |
| **STRD**         | Resistor                 | Adds discipline, controls volatility and risk in the capital stack   |
| **STRC**         | Capacitor                | Stores conviction and releases it under specific conditions          |
| **STRF**         | Magnetic Field           | Exerts influence on Bitcoin capital flows without direct contact     |

## üß† Design Intent

Bitcoin is energy. Its capital stack forms the hardware.  
This model helps investors, engineers, and students understand Bitcoin as physics, not finance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Visualize current flow over time
- Overlay hashrate as energy input
- Create real-time simulation of the capital stack as a dynamic electric circuit
